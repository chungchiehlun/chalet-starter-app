## Create Starter App
Create-starter-app was similar to [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). When using *create-react-app*, you will get merely *react*, *react-dom* in your project folder. However, if you hope to bootstrap a project, the *redux*, *react-router*, and so on is necessary. That's why **create-starter-app** come. It applied the [charlet-starter-app](https://github.com/chungchiehlun/chalet-starter-app) to bootstrap production-based project. Absolutely! You could also refer to the elaborate document of create-react-app [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) to enhance your project.
